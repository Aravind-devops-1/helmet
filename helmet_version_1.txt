Base Diameter: 30 cm.

Components:
___________

Water Tank: A small, portable tank to store water.
Low-Voltage DC Pump: A small, low-voltage DC pump to increase water pressure.
Ultrasonic Mist Nozzles: Multiple ultrasonic mist nozzles to produce a fine mist:Rain Bird R-VAN14
Microcontroller: To control the pump, nozzles, and timing.
Battery: A rechargeable battery to power the system.
Frame: A simple frame to hold the components.
Design:

Nozzle Placement:

Circular Arrangement: Place the nozzles equidistantly around the circumference of the cylinder.
Nozzle Angle: Adjust the nozzle angle to ensure the mist reaches the center of the cylinder.
Water Flow Rate:

The microcontroller will control the pump's speed to regulate the water flow rate.
Water Pressure:

The pump will increase the water pressure to ensure the mist is dispersed effectively.
Automation:

Microcontroller: The microcontroller will control the pump's operation, the duration of the spray, and the rotation of the nozzles (if implemented).
Timer: Set a timer to control the duration of the spray cycle.
Sensor (Optional): A humidity sensor can be used to trigger the system when the humidity inside the cylinder drops below a certain threshold.

Component Selection: Choose specific components based on your budget, performance requirements, and availability.
Circuit Design: Design a circuit to power the pump, microcontroller, and nozzles.
Programming: Write code for the microcontroller to control the system's operation.
Assembly: Assemble the components onto the frame.
Testing: Test the system to ensure it works as expected.


Sample code


#include <Wire.h>
#include <RTClib.h> // Include if using RTC

// Pin definitions
const int pumpPin = 7; // Relay pin for the pump
const int nozzlePin = 8; // Relay pin for the nozzle (if applicable)

// Timing variables
unsigned long sprayDuration = 10000; // Spray for 10 seconds
unsigned long interval = 60000; // Spray every 60 seconds

// RTC setup (if using)
RTC_DS3231 rtc;

void setup() {
  pinMode(pumpPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(nozzlePin, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(pumpPin, LOW); // Ensure pump is off
  digitalWrite(nozzlePin, LOW); // Ensure nozzle is off

  // Initialize RTC (if using)
  if (!rtc.begin()) {
    Serial.println("Couldn't find RTC");
    while (1);
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Example timing logic
  static unsigned long lastSprayTime = 0;
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();

  if (currentMillis - lastSprayTime >= interval) {
    lastSprayTime = currentMillis;

    // Activate pump and nozzle
    digitalWrite(pumpPin, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(nozzlePin, HIGH);
    delay(sprayDuration); // Spray for the defined duration
    digitalWrite(pumpPin, LOW);
    digitalWrite(nozzlePin, LOW);
  }

  // Additional logic can be added here (e.g., sensor readings)
